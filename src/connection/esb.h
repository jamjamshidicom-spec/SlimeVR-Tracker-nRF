 * Note for the future:
 *
 * Best channels and frequencies to use:
 * 20, 21, 22, 23, 24: 2420MHz to 2424Mhz - BT channels 8, 9, 10 outside of WiFi channels
 * 48, 49, 50, 51, 52: 2448MHz to 2452Mhz - BT channels 21, 22, 23 outside of WiFi channels
 * 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78: 2472MHz to 2478Mhz - BT channels 33, 34, 35, 36 outside WiFi channels
 * 82, 83: 2482Mhz to 2483Mhz - outside of used WiFi and BT spectrums
 * Higher channels can be restricted by country.
 * 
 * TODO : Make a list of allowed channels by country
 * 
 * WARNING: Using nearby channels can lead to overlap, i.e. packets sent to Channel 20
 * can be received by a device tuned to Channel 21, so it's recommended to
 * ONLY USE EVEN CHANNELS
